# Assignment 01

In this assignment, there are two parts, each covering four types of multi-armed bandit algorithms. Therefore, there are two separate .ipynb notebook files, one for each part.

## How to Run the Code

1. **Choose a tool**:  
   You can use either:
   - **Google Colab**  
   - **VS Code** with Jupyter extension  
   - **Jupyter Notebook**

2. **File type**:  
   The file is a `.ipynb` (Jupyter Notebook) file.

3. **Run the code**:  
   - Open the notebook.  
   - Run all the cells from top to bottom.  
   - You will see two graphs:
     - Average Reward vs Time Steps  
     - Optimal Action % vs Time Steps

## What the Code Does

- Simulates 10 arms, 2000 steps, and 1000 simulations.
- Tracks:
  - Average reward at each time step.
  - How often the best arm was chosen.

## Requirements

You need these Python libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
```
